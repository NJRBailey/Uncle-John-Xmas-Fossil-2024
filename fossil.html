            This ammonite fossil was discovered in Kettleness, a coastal region near Whitby in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom, known for its rich deposits of Jurassic-era fossils. The geology of this area is characterized by sedimentary rock formations, primarily shales and limestones, dating back approximately 180 million years to the Lower Jurassic period. These rock layers are part of the Lias Group, which was formed in a shallow marine environment, making them abundant in marine fossils like ammonites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Natural erosion processes, such as wave action and weathering, continually expose new fossils along the cliffs and shoreline of Kettleness. Fossil collectors and paleontologists often search this area, especially after storms or coastal erosion events that reveal previously-buried specimens. This ammonite was carefully extracted from the surrounding rock matrix using specialized tools to preserve its delicate structures. After extraction, the fossil was sculpted into the form of St. Hilda's snakestone, a practice that merges paleontological discovery with local cultural traditions.

            Ammonites were marine molluscs that thrived in the Earth's oceans from around 400 to 65 million years ago, coexisting with the dinosaurs. Resembling the modern nautilus, these creatures lived in coiled shells divided into chambers. As they grew, they built new, larger chambers and sealed off the old ones, using them to control buoyancy in the water. Propelling themselves through the ancient seas using jet propulsion, they maneuvered adeptly to hunt and evade predators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carnivorous by nature, ammonites fed on a diet of small marine organisms such as plankton, crustaceans, and other tiny creatures. They captured their prey with tentacle-like appendages, drawing food towards a beak-like jaw capable of cracking shells. Their position in the food chain was vital, serving both as predators and as prey for larger marine reptiles like mosasaurs. The widespread presence and rapid evolution of ammonites make their fossils valuable to scientists for dating geological formations.

            Saint Hilda was a revered abbess in the 7th century who founded the monastery at Whitby, which became a centre of learning and religious significance in medieval England. Known for her wisdom and leadership, she played a key role in the Synod of Whitby, which helped unify the practices of the English church. St. Hilda was celebrated not only for her spiritual influence but also for the legends which arose around her life and deeds.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such legend tells of St. Hilda miraculously transforming plague-bearing snakes into stone, casting them from the cliffs of Whitby. The coiled ammonite fossils commonly found in the area were embraced as physical proof of this miracle, believed to be the petrified remains of those serpents. Locals began to carve snake heads onto these fossils, creating "snakestones" that merged natural history with spiritual folklore. This tradition not only highlights the region's rich cultural tapestry but also symbolizes the intertwining of faith and the natural world.
